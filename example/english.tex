Because the DS equations are algebraic when \(D=0\), we can derive this asymptotic behavior analytically: We substitute \(G_{2 n}=(-1)^{n+1}(2 n-1) ! g_{2 n}\), multiply the \(2 n\)th DS equation by \(x^{2 n}\), sum from \(n=1\) to \(\infty\), and define the generating function \(u(x) \equiv x g_2+x^3 g_4+x^5 g_6+\cdots\). The differential equation satisfied by \(u(x)\) is nonlinear:
\[
u^{\prime \prime}(x)=3 u^{\prime}(x) u(x)-u^3(x)-x,
\]
where \(u(0)=0\) and \(u^{\prime}(0)=G_2\). We linearize (5) by substituting \(u(x)=-y^{\prime}(x) / y(x)\) and get \(y^{\prime \prime \prime}(x)=x y(x)\), where \(y(0)=1, y^{\prime}(0)=0, y^{\prime \prime}(0)=-G_2\). The exact solution satisfying these initial conditions is
\[
y(x)=\frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{\Gamma(1 / 4)} \int_0^{\infty} d t \cos (x t) e^{-t^4 / 4} .
\]
If \(y(x)=0\), the generating function \(u(x)\) becomes infinite, so the smallest value of \(|x|\) at which \(y(x)=0\) is the radius of convergence of the series for \(u(x)\). A simple plot shows that \(y(x)\) vanishes at \(x_0= \pm 2.4419682 \ldots\) [9]. Therefore, \(r=1 / x_0=0.409506 \ldots\), which confirms (4).

The asymptotic behavior in (4) indicates that \(G_{2 n}\) grows much faster than the \(\gamma_{2 n}\) as \(n \rightarrow \infty\) :
\[
\gamma_{2 n}=\frac{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d x x^{2 n} e^{-x^4 / 4}}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d x e^{-x^4 / 4}} \sim 2^n \frac{\Gamma(n / 2+1 / 4)}{\Gamma(1 / 4)}
\]
